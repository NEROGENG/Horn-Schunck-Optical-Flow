# Horn-Schunck Optical Flow
We will implement Horn-Schunk's optical flow algorithm in Matlab and C++. 
Our goal is to learn the algorithm and compare the performance metrics (time, memory, and etc.) of the two implementations.

## How to Run C++ Implementation
First, download the OpenCV library from http://opencv.org/downloads.html. Particularly, the optical flow code developed for this repository was created under the following environment:

- Windows 8, 64-bit
- Microsoft Visual Studio 2015
- OpenCV 3.0

To emulate this exact environment, watch the following video (thanks to the user nurimbet!): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l4372qtZ4dc

For other environments, refer to the documentation provided by OpenCV: http://opencv.org/documentation.html
